Bridges are essential for connecting regions and enabling transportation, but during floods, they can become hazardous due to inefficient traditional lifting mechanisms, leading to traffic disruptions or collapse. To address this, our team developed an automatic height-adjusting bridge using an Arduino, a moisture or water level sensor, and servo motors. The sensor detects rising water levels and sends data to the Arduino, which then activates the servo motors to elevate the bridge to a safe height. As water levels recede, the bridge lowers accordingly, ensuring continuous safety and functionality during heavy rains or floods.
